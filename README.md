# NDSU Seed Archive Program

Tool to replace Microsoft Excel for storage and management of the NDSU Research Center seed archive database.

## Program compressed down to one file
* Place the SeedArchive.exe file inside a folder with the data, backup, and assets folder
* Create a shortcut for the SeedArchive.exe file and place it on the desktop
* Please test this out and let me know because I'm hoping this will be the release style from now on
